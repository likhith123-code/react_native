Scroll view is used when we know that the items will be limited.
<ScrollView></ScrollView>

Flatlist is used when we have large amounts of list. Flat list will automatically add the keys to the list items.
The keys are added only when the data array is in particular array.
The data array is array of strings then the key is not added. So store in form oj object with key as random
and value as out data. So flat list can be easily added into the list items.
<FlatList data={array} renderItem={itemData=>()} 
Print the data itemData.item. If value is needed itemData.item.value (in case of object).

GoalInput : 
The entered Goal useState is managed in the goal input.
To handle the addtoList method we create a prop in the custom component in the App.js and use it in the GoalInput.
Also pass entered goal as a parameter in the Button in goalInput.js because in the App.js we add to the existing list.

Deleting the Item : 
We want to make list item as touchable one. So we use inbuilt touchable wrapper. We also have touchable opacity
which has some more features like onPress, onLongPress, activeOpacity etc.
Now wrap in goal item to get this work.
Similarly we have touchable highlight and so on which have some different effects on touching the items.

Ondelete Handler : 
we use the filter method in js. It will keep the items which satisfy the given condition. If not satisfied it wont
keep the item. The filter method return the new array after filtering all the things.

Pass id as parameter to the delete function.

Modal View :
Model view has visible property. If it is false then the content inside it will not be visible. So we keep a Button
on clicking that button we send a property value as true or false and manage that in the goalinput component.
Model takes complete screen of device.
On adding the item we need to remove the model. So in the button add handler make model visible as false.
It re-renders everything so when we made the change the model will disappear so only the button and list appears
text box and add button wont come.when model appears remaining will disappear.
The Modal component is a basic way to present content above an enclosing view.
